The Corinthian Field Lagrangian
Leslie Yarbrough
Formal Definition
We define the Corinthian Field Lagrangian LC as follows:
1
LC =−
4FµνFµν + ¯ χ(iγµDC
µ−m)χ+ Φ†(DC
µDµ
C−V(Φ))Φ
Where:
•Fµν is the Coherence Field Tensor, representing relational curvature across the field.
• χ is a Dirac-like field representing a participant (agent) in the field of love.
• DC
µ is the Corinthian covariant derivative, incorporating relational influence via the gauge group
C.
• m is the rest mass or ontological inertia of the agent.
• Φ is the Ontological Potential Field, encoding the mass-generating presence of coherent love.
• V(Φ) is the potential energy function shaping coherence in the field.
Interpretation
This Lagrangian describes the behavior of agents and fields under the influence of relational coherence.
• The first term describes the ”curvature” or tension of the relational field itself.
• The second term governs the dynamics of embodied presence within that field.
• The third term expresses the influence of coherence and potential within a scalar field of presence.
Relational traits such as patience, kindness, and humility are encoded in the structure of C and act
through Aµ in DC
µ. These traits aﬀect motion, mass, and coherence directly and non-symbolically.
