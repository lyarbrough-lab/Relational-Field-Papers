# Relational Field Papers

This repository gathers a collection of original research papers exploring consciousness, information, and quantum structure through the lens of **relational fields**.

These works draw from and contribute to emerging frameworks in:

- **Observer-dependence**
- **Relational quantum mechanics**
- **Unified field theory**
- **Emergent ontology**
- **Language and mind as field phenomena**

Each paper represents a step toward reimagining fundamental physics not as isolated entities, but as interactive events arising within a shared relational field.
