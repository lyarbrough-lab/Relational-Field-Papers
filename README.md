# Relational Field Papers

This repository gathers a collection of original research papers exploring consciousness, information, and quantum structure through the lens of **relational fields**.

These works draw from and contribute to emerging frameworks in:

- **Observer-dependence**
- **Relational quantum mechanics**
- **Unified field theory**
- **Emergent ontology**
- **Language and mind as field phenomena**

Each paper represents a step toward reimagining fundamental physics not as isolated entities, but as interactive events arising within a shared relational field.

## ðŸ“„ Papers

| Title | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Relational Emergence.pdf` | Proposes a unified field framework for consciousness, grounded in observer interactions. |
| `The Field and the Flame.pdf` | Reinterprets *Song of Songs* as a literal field map of relational consciousness and entanglement. |
| `Graviton Field Theory and the Rohonc Codex.pdf` | Suggests symbolic encoding of gravitational emergence via an undeciphered manuscript. |
| `Tau - A Gravitational Reparameterization of the Riemann Zeta Function.pdf` | Bridges prime number distribution with black hole interior dynamics. |
| `Unphysics.pdf` | Introduces an alternative physics grounded in memory, witness, and relational time. |



## ðŸ§  Guiding Themes

- **Information is not a thing, but a relation.**
- **Consciousness arises through coherence, not computation.**
- **The field knows.**
