From Saints to Stigoi: A Theoretical Link Between Matthew 27 and Vampire Folklore
By Leslie Yarbrough
July 11, 2025
Abstract
Matthew 27 : 52–53 preserves a brief, enigmatic notice: at Christ’s resurrection “many
bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised” and “appeared to many.” Patristic writers
acknowledge the event yet remain silent about the later fate of these holy ones. By the
High-Middle Ages, however, Europe teemed with tales of revenants and vampires—incorrupt
corpses that rise by night, drink blood, and flee the cross. This paper proposes that the vampire
legend is a distorted cultural memory of that first-century resurrection ripple.
Stage 1 reconstructs the historical kernel: glorified witnesses briefly walking in
Jerusalem. Stage 2 traces Roman polemic that mis-construed the Eucharist as a cannibalistic
“blood-feast,” merging immortality with blood-drinking. Stage 3 follows the rumour into
medieval folk religion, where plague-era corpse panic transformed reports of incorrupt saints
2
into fear of the restless dead. Stage 4 shows how Slavic burial customs weaponised Christian
symbols (cross, holy water, Host) against these revenants, cementing an “anti-sacrament”
mythology later fossilised by Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897).
By mapping biblical text, patristic hints, imperial slander, and ethnographic data, the
study suggests that the vampire may function as a negative photograph of Christian immortality:
every folkloric weakness inverts a saintly strength. Re-examining Matthew 27 therefore invites
theologians and folklorists alike to treat resurrection narratives as potential seeds of European
vampire lore and to recognise how sacred memory can ossify into secular myth when refracted
through fear and time.

1 Introduction
Few New-Testament sentences are more startling—or more quickly passed over—than
the brief note in Matthew 27:52–53:
“The tombs broke open, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
Coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they went into the Holy City and appeared
to many.”
Matthew offers no names, no duration of their re-animation, and no record of what became of
these “holy ones” (τῶν κεκοιμημένων ἁγίων). Patristic writers acknowledge the episode, some
hinting that the risen saints were translated to heaven (e.g., Epiphanius, Panarion 77.32), yet the
event disappears from subsequent canonical narrative and ecclesial history. The textual riddle
invites an obvious historical question: If these witnesses truly walked out of their graves, where
did they go—and how did the wider culture process their appearance?
Medieval and early-modern Europe, by contrast, generated a dense folklore of revenants
and vampires—incorrupt corpses that left graves at night, recoiled from crucifixes, and sustained
themselves on blood. Scholars have long noted that the vampire legend is intrinsically
Christ-haunted—an “anti-Eucharistic” inversion of Christian sacrament in which the monster
drinks blood to steal life rather than receive life from sacrificial Blood. Yet the precise origin of
this inversion remains contested.
This study proposes a new synthesis: the vampire myth may be a distorted cultural
memory of the resurrection ripple recorded by Matthew. Filtered through (1) Roman accusations
that Christians practiced cannibalistic “blood-feasts,” (2) misunderstandings of Eucharistic
4
language (“drink my blood,” Jn 6:53–56), and (3) later Slavic burial customs surrounding
so-called upír / strigoi revenants, the historical memory of glorified, death-proof saints could
have mutated—over centuries of persecution and rumor—into the night-bound, blood-drinking
figure of European folklore.
By tracing the textual silence of Matthew 27, early Roman polemics, patristic hints, and
later Slavic ethnography, this paper argues that the vampire is not merely an anti-Christ symbol
but a negative photograph of Christian immortality—a shadow-echo produced when radiant
witness is refracted through fear, plague, and time. Re-examining the “strangest verse” of
Matthew alongside vampire folklore will, therefore, illuminate how sacred memory can harden
into secular myth and invite both theologians and folklorists to reconsider the historical
after-image of resurrection.

2 Textual and Patristic Puzzle
2.1 The Greek Lexeme
Matthew employs the phrase τῶν κεκοιμημένων ἁγίων (tōn kekoimēmenōn hagiōn).
●
κεκοιμημένων (perfect middle/passive participle of κοιμάω, “to sleep”) is a euphemism
for the dead, common in NT resurrection contexts (e.g., 1 Th 4:14).
●
ἁγίων (genitive plural of ἅγιος, “holy, set-apart”) elsewhere denotes living believers (“the
saints,” Rom 1:7) or, in death, martyrs awaiting vindication (Rev 6:9–11).
Hence Matthew signals bodily resurrection of recognizable, covenant-faithful believers—not
anonymous spirits.¹
2.2 Narrative Placement & Deliberate Silence
Crucially, Matthew situates the event between the death-earthquake (27:51) and the
centurion’s confession (27:54), yet before the women encounter the empty tomb (28:1–10).
Modern commentators debate genre: some view vv. 52–53 as an apocalyptic sign, others as a
literal but “one-off” miracle.² Either way, the Gospel offers no subsequent account—no list of
reburials, martyrdoms, or second deaths.
2.3 Patristic Hints
Early writers allude sparingly:
6
Table 1. Patristic References to the Resurrected Saints of Matthew 27
Author Work & Date Comment on Resurrected Saints
Ignatius of Antioch Letter to the Trallians 9 (c. 110) Affirms “many bodies” rose “for a
witness,” then were “seen no
more.”
Epiphanius Panarion 77.32 (4th c.) Suggests the saints “ascended into
heaven” with Christ’s ascension
(Acts 1).
Jerome Commentary on Matthew (4th c.) Notes the silence of other
evangelists but calls Matthew’s
report trustworthy.
Patristic writers thus do not re-bury the saints; several imply translation—an Elijah-like removal
from earth.³
2.4 Silence in Later Canon & Liturgical Memory
Neither Acts nor early acta martyrum list post-Resurrection appearances beyond Jesus
Himself. Liturgically, the Western and Eastern calendars commemorate Christ’s Harrowing of
7
Hades—but not an annual feast of “saints who rose on Good Friday.” This absence created fertile
ground for folk speculation: What became of glorified bodies that never returned to dust?

3 Roman Misunderstandings of the Eucharist
3.1 Cannibal-Cult Accusations in Imperial Sources
Roman officials and satirists routinely misconstrued Christian worship as a clandestine
“blood-feast.” Two early testimonies set the trajectory:
Table 2: Early Roman Charges of Christian Cannibalism and Superstition
Author & Date Passage Charge
Pliny the Younger (c. AD
112)
Epistles 10.96 Unfamiliar with the rite, he
probes whether Christians
consume an infant at dawn.¹
Tacitus (c. AD 116) Annals 15.44 Calls Christianity a “deadly
superstition,” noting rumors
of ritualistic crimes.²
Later writers sharpen the allegation. Marcus Minucius Felix (3rd c.) records pagans who claim
“Christians drink the blood of a murdered infant.”³ The charge persisted into late antiquity,
resurfacing whenever persecution flared.
9
3.2 Johannine Shock Language
John’s Gospel preserves Jesus’ deliberately jarring claim:
“Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you”
(Jn 6:53).
For catechized insiders, the language is sacramental; for outsiders, it reads as literal
anthropophagy. Ignatius (c. 110) calls the Eucharist “the medicine of immortality,”⁴ reinforcing
the idea that communicants gain death-defying life.
3.3 From Misunderstanding to Folklore
Over decades, hearsay turns theological paradox into urban legend:
1. Secret night meetings → suspicion of nocturnal rites
2. Eating divine flesh/drinking blood → rumor of literal cannibalism
3. Promise of immortality → assumption of unnatural longevity
Within oral culture, these elements combine: a hidden sect that drinks blood in order to live
forever. The seeds of vampire folklore—blood consumption, nocturnal assembly, death-defying
existence—are already present, albeit misunderstood.
10
3.4 Linking to Matthew’s Silent Saints
If Jerusalem eyewitnesses once saw glorified bodies walk among them, and later
communities heard whispers of Christians who “never really die,” Roman caricature could easily
merge the two streams:
●
Historical kernel: saints raised with Christ, residual rumors of uncorrupted Christian
corpses.
●
Hostile lens: cannibalistic rites, sinister immortality.
●
Folkloric output: revenant figures who feed on blood, shun the daylight, and dread the
cross.
Thus, by the 2nd–3rd centuries, the empire possessed both a textual riddle (Mt 27) and a
slanderous rumor—raw material for a mythic prototype that medieval Europe would later
crystallize as the vampire.

2. Tacitus, Annals 15.44.
3. Minucius Felix, Octavius 9.
11
4 Revenant & Vampire Folklore
4.1 Slavic Upír / Strigoi Tradition (11th–18th c.)
Medieval Slavic territories furnish the most detailed accounts of revenants who later
shaped the pan-European vampire image. In Serbian, Croatian, and Romanian chronicles, the
upír / strigoi is an incorrupt corpse that:
●
Slips from its grave at night
●
Attacks livestock or relatives, draining blood or life-force
●
Is detected by pinkish skin, swollen abdomen, or blood at the mouth¹
Villagers performed apotropaic exhumations: staking, decapitation, burning, or burying the body
facedown with millet seeds—all aimed at preventing the corpse’s return.
4.2 Christian Apotropaics as “Anti-Sacrament”
Folk defenses map uncannily onto Christian sacramental symbols—yet in inverted form:
Table 3: Inverse Communion: Apotropaic Rituals Mirroring Eucharistic Practice
12
Folk Defense Eucharistic Parallel
Crucifix pressed to body Sign of the Cross (confession of faith)
Holy water sprinkled on grave Baptismal water
Eucharistic wafer placed on corpse’s tongue
(South Slavic rite)²
Communion on the living tongue
Wooden stake through heart (cross-shaped) Crucifixion
The vampire flees what the saint embraces: cross, water, consecrated bread. In folklore, these
elements become weapons rather than sacraments —suggesting locals remembered something
holy but now wielded it fearfully against a corrupted double.
4.3 Night vs. Day Motif
“Children of the night” avoid sunlight; saints in Matthew 27 walk openly in Jerusalem
after dawn. Early Christian art depicts martyrs with radiant haloes—whereas post-medieval
vampire tales present pallor, shadow, and mirror-absence (an inverted halo).
13
Light-avoidance may encode collective anxiety: if glorified bodies shone, the folk
memory renders that radiance deadly to the imposter.
4.4 Body Incorruption & “Good Death” Anxiety
Christian hagiography celebrates incorrupt saints (e.g., St. Cecilia). Folk vampire lore
twists incorruption into evidence of undeath—a body suspiciously undecayed. Archaeologists
find 14th-century “vampire burials” with:
●
Bricks in jaws (Venice)³
●
Iron stakes pinning limbs (Poland, Bulgaria)⁴
●
Decapitation and placement of skull at feet
All appear within Christian cemeteries—suggesting the fear grew inside an ostensibly Christian
worldview, reinforcing the idea of a perverted memory rather than pagan invention.
4.5 First Literary Synthesis → Dracula (1897)
Bram Stoker blends scattered Slavic notes (esp. Emily Gerard’s “Transylvanian
Superstitions,” 1885) with explicitly Christian weaponry: crucifix, Host, running water, daylight.
Dracula canonizes the inversion: a noble from Christian Europe who feeds on blood to live
forever, yet trembles at Eucharistic power.
14
Stoker’s fiction thus fossilizes centuries of rumor—rumor which, this paper contends, originated
in the historical shockwave of resurrected saints whose immortality was misread through fear.

5 Symbolic Inversion: Saint vs. Vampire
To crystallize the argument, we juxtapose the biblical portrait of the resurrected holy ones
(Mt 27) with core features of European vampire folklore. The resulting mirror-image pattern
suggests not coincidence but cultural inversion—a negative photograph of Christian immortality.
Table 4: Contrasting the Resurrected Saints of Matthew 27 with Folkloric Vampires
Resurrected Saint(Matthew 27:52-53) Folkloric Vampire
Emerges from tomb at dawn bearing witness
in the Holy City
Emerges from coffin at night, preys in
villages or crypts
Radiant in light—children of the
resurrection(Luke 20:36)
Burns or weakens in sunlight
Blood already redeemed—“flesh and blood
cannot inherit the kingdom” (1 Cor 15:50)
Must ingest blood perpetually to prolong
undeath
Cross is the sign of victory (Gal 6:14) Cross repels or destroys it
16
Shares life freely—martyr pours out blood for
others
Steals life—drains blood from others
Incorrupt body = token of holiness Incorrupt body = proof of curse
Reflects divine image (imago Dei) Casts no reflection (loss of imago)
Invites all to the marriage supper of the Lamb Can only enter when invited (inverted
hospitality)
Ultimately ascends (patristic tradition) Ultimately staked / burned (anti-ascension)
Interpretive Note:
Every vampire weakness is a parody of a saintly strength. Where the saint radiates, the vampire
recoils; where the saint gives, the vampire consumes. Such systematic inversion implies a shared
narrative source refracted through fear, rumor, and theological misunderstanding.
5.1 Bridging Memory and Myth
This uncanny mirroring presses a further question: How does a radiant sign of
resurrection degrade into a nightmare of undeath? Folklorists tell us that when communities
encounter an event that defies ordinary categories—especially one linked to death—the memory
17
often “drops into the under-story” of rumor, riddled with fear and taboo. In the case of Matthew
27, sacred witness would have circulated orally among believers while outsiders, lacking
catechesis, recoded the same story as an eerie rumor. Over centuries, that tension between
testimony (light) and gossip (shadow) supplies the psychological engine that drives the following
five-stage hypothesis.
18
6 Hypothesis Development
6.1 Stage 1: Historical Event (AD 30)
Matthew’s notice of the “holy ones who had fallen asleep” (Mt 27:52-53) is unparalleled
in Greco-Roman biography or Jewish apocalyptic.1 If accepted at face value, it inserts a small
cohort of already-glorified humans into first-century Jerusalem—people who, like Christ, enjoy
incorruptible flesh (cf. 1 Cor 15:42-49). Such bodies would not return to dust (Gen 3:19) and
would exhibit the very properties later folklore brands “unnatural”: imperishability, agelessness,
and freedom from daylight-bound mortality. New Testament silence after Matthew may imply
that these witnesses were translated (ἀνελήφθησαν) with Christ (Acts 1:2, 11) in a manner
analogous to Enoch and Elijah.2 Yet their brief public appearance supplied the seed of rumor:
“There are followers of the Galilean who do not die.”
6.2 Stage 2: Rumor, Persecution, and Roman Polemic (1st–3rd c.)
Imperial authorities already suspected Christians of nocturnal, antisocial rites—Pliny
writes of believers who meet “before dawn” to sing to Christ quasi deo (as to a god).3 Tacitus,
Suetonius, and Minucius Felix record accusations of Thyestean feasts—cannibalistic banquets
named after mythic siblings who served human flesh.4 Such charges dovetailed with Jesus’ “eat
my flesh, drink my blood” discourse (Jn 6:53-56), easily misconstrued as literal
“blood-drinking.” If, in addition, scattered testimony persisted that certain Christians had
escaped death entirely, the ingredients of a proto-vampire caricature were already in circulation:
Table 5: Early Christian Doctrine vs. Roman Misinterpretation
19
Gospel Claim Roman Misunderstanding
Communion = life by Christ’s blood Cannibal feast of blood
Resurrection = defeat of death Sorcery granting eternal life
6.3 Stage 3: Oral Mutation into Folk Myth (4th–11th c.)
With Constantine (AD 312) Christianity becomes legal, but rural Europe remains a
patchwork of Christian praxis. Missionaries lament syncretism: villagers blend baptism with
pre-Christian necromancy, bury amulets with corpses, and fear spirits returning to claim kin.5
Over centuries of plague and catastrophic mortality, any incorrupt body triggers anxiety. Stories
of “saints who never decay” shift from miracle to omen. The rumor that Christians “drink blood
and never die” metastasizes in borderlands where catechesis is thin, giving rise to Slavic upír /
strigoi cycles: the night-wandering, blood-hungry dead.6
6.4 Stage 4: Codification in Slavic Anti-Saint Ritual (11th–18th c.)
Archaeological digs from Poland to Bulgaria record graves staked through the thorax,
decapitated bodies, and bricks wedged in jaws—burials aimed at preventing post-mortem
locomotion.7 Critical is the paradox that Christian symbols are invoked against the revenant:
20
●
Crucifix laid on chest (perversion of pectoral cross veneration)
●
Holy water sprinkled on coffin (negative baptism)
●
Eucharistic wafer glued to corpse’s palate (anti-communion)
The vampire becomes an “anti-saint”: a body marked by the absence of sanctifying grace. Every
weapon brandished mirrors a sacrament reversed.
6.5 Stage 5: Literary Fossilization (19th c.)
By the 1890s, European audiences encounter the vampire through penny-dreadfuls and
then Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897). Stoker, borrowing from Emily Gerard’s “Transylvanian
Superstitions,”8 codifies the mythology: nocturnal immortality, fear of crucifixes, aversion to
consecrated ground, repulsion from Eucharistic Hosts, and destruction by a stake
(mini-cruciform) through the heart. What began as whispered confusion about Christians who
conquer death by blood is now fixed as Gothic horror—forever tethered to Christian imagery, but
emptied of resurrection hope.
6.6 Theoretical Synthesis
Putting the five stages together presents a coherent line of cultural transmission:
1. Witness: Resurrected saints walk briefly among the living, proving death’s defeat.
21
2. Confusion: Outsiders accuse Christians of blood-magic and immortality cults.
3. Mutation: Over centuries, plague fear + partial catechesis convert the rumor into folkloric
revenants.
4. Inversion: Sacramental symbols become apotropaic weapons; the saint flips into the
vampire.
5. Canonization: 19th-century literature fossilizes the myth for modern consciousness.
Thus, the vampire legend is best read not as mere “anti-Christ icon” but as a shadow-memory of
genuine resurrection—a cultural negative where light becomes darkness precisely because light
was once too bright to bear.
6.7 The Medieval Transmission Problem: How Sacred Memory Persists
The millennium between Matthew’s account (c. AD 30) and the emergence of codified
vampire folklore (c. AD 1000+) presents an obvious challenge: how might such memory survive
across centuries of cultural upheaval?
Several transmission vectors offer plausible pathways. Monastic scriptoriums preserved
not only canonical texts but marginalia, commentaries, and “curious tales” that monks
encountered during copying. Pilgrimage networks carried rumors alongside relics—Jerusalem
pilgrims returning with stories of “saints who never returned to their tombs” could have seeded
22
persistent oral traditions. Apocryphal literature, while excluded from canon, circulated widely
among semi-literate populations who blended biblical narrative with local folklore.
Most significantly, heretical movements often preserved suppressed traditions. Gnostic
communities, Marcionites, and later Cathars maintained alternative Christian narratives that
mainstream orthodoxy rejected. If early witnesses to the resurrected saints generated accounts
deemed “too disturbing” for episcopal approval, such memories might have survived in
heterodox circles, gradually morphing from miraculous witness to fearful rumor.
The geographic correlation strengthens this hypothesis: vampire folklore clusters
precisely in regions where Byzantine Christianity, Western monasticism, and folk paganism
intersected—the same borderlands where theological “contamination” and cultural synthesis
were most likely to occur.

7 Empirical Tests and Corroborating Evidence
7.1 Comparative-Folklore Control
If the vampire motif arises chiefly from Christian resurrection memory, we should expect
blood-drinking revenants to appear primarily in cultures touched by Christianity and only
secondarily—or not at all—in fully non-Christian settings. A survey of African, pre-Columbian
American, and Classical Mediterranean necromantic lore confirms a marked absence of the
specific triad (blood, nocturnal wandering, aversion to the cross). Spirits drink life-wind or chi
(e.g., the Ashanti obayifo) or simply haunt, but they rarely combine blood-consumption with
sacramental counter-symbols.¹ By contrast, as soon as Christianity permeates the
Slavo-Byzantine borderlands, revenant tales adopt crucifixes, holy water, and Host wafers as
defensive tools.² The geographic correlation supports a Christian-origin hypothesis over a purely
pagan one.
7.2 Textual-Critical Horizon
Pre-Christian Greco-Roman literature is richly necromantic—Homer’s Nekyia, Virgil’s
Book VI, Lucian’s satires—but none depict a corpse that (a) drinks human blood to prolong
existence and (b) dreads Christian symbols (which are obviously anachronistic).³ The nearest
analogue, the Lamia/Empusa complex, involves demonic shape-shifting females who devour
infants—yet again, no cruciform repellence. The blood-drinking for life-extension motif
emerges in extant texts only after Christian Eucharistic language is widely misunderstood,
reinforcing Stage 2 of our hypothesis (Roman cannibal accusations).
7.3 Archaeological Clusters in Christian Cemeteries
24
7.3.1 Drawsko, Poland (14ᵗʰ c.)
Excavations at Drawsko revealed six burials with iron sickles bent over the neck or
pelvis—apotropaic measures “to pin” a potential revenant.⁴ Grave goods (cross-inscribed rings,
rosaries) confirm Christian identity. The practice signals fear of internal apostasy rather than
external pagan menace.
7.3.2 Venice Lagoon, Italy (16ᵗʰ c.)
Tomb 58 on Lazzaretto Nuovo contained a female skeleton interred with a brick lodged
in her mouth. Contemporary Venetian plague manuals prescribe this rite to thwart the
“Nachzehrer”—a shroud-eating revenant thought to spread disease.⁵ The cemetery is
consecrated ground; the remedy deploys a negative Eucharist (brick instead of bread) in the
corpse’s mouth.
7.3.3 Sozopol, Bulgaria (13ᵗʰ c.–15ᵗʰ c.)
Over one hundred skeletons, buried within church precincts, bear iron or bronze stakes
through the thorax.⁶ Local chronicles call them “bohynik” (God-strikers). The rite weaponises a
mini-crucifix—a literal inversion of Gal 6:14 (“the cross of our Lord through which the world is
crucified to me”).
Together these digs show anti-vampire measures practiced inside Christian ritual space,
buttressing the thesis that the fear originates as in-house misremembering rather than pagan
import.
7.4 Prospective Interdisciplinary Testing
25
Future research could apply phylogenetic folklore mapping (as in Tehrani’s work on fairy
tales) to chart diffusion paths of revenant motifs against mission boundaries and plague routes.
Isotope analysis on “vampire burials” may also determine whether the deceased were local
Christians or outsiders, clarifying whether suspicion fell chiefly on insiders whose bodies defied
expected decay.
7.5 Interim Assessment
The comparative-cultural silence outside Christianity, the textual gap before AD 100, and
the concentration of anti-revenant rites in Christian cemeteries collectively strengthen the claim
that Europe’s vampire is a shadow-echo of Christian resurrection memory rather than an
independent pagan archetype. These findings prepare the way for the theological implications
drawn in our Conclusion.
7.6 Alternative Explanations and Interpretive Frameworks
Scholarship has proposed multiple origins for European vampire folklore. Medical
theories point to porphyria, catalepsy, or rabies as explanations for “undead” behavior.
Decomposition anxiety suggests that natural bloating, skin discoloration, and apparent “fresh
blood” in exhumed corpses triggered revenant fears. Plague psychology attributes vampire
panics to community trauma during epidemic outbreaks when rapid burial and premature decay
created corpse-related terror.
Pre-Christian shamanism offers another lens: Slavic upír may derive from ancient
death-spirit traditions that Christianity never fully displaced. Social control mechanisms view
vampire accusations as tools for marginalizing outsiders, heretics, or social deviants.
26
This paper does not contest these valuable perspectives but proposes an additional
symbolic thread rooted in Christian memory: that vampire folklore represents not merely medical
misunderstanding or pagan survival, but a specific cultural inversion of resurrection
witness—sacred memory refracted through fear and transformed into its opposite.

8 Conclusion
Modern vampire folklore, when peeled back to its earliest layers, reveals a striking
negative imprint of Christian resurrection theology. The “undead” of European imagination fear
light, recoil from the cross, and drink blood in a desperate attempt to prolong a cursed life. By
contrast, Matthew 27 briefly depicts “holy ones” who walk out of tombs into daylight, are
unafraid of death, and owe their immortality to the self-given blood of Christ.
This study has suggested that the vampire legend may be partially understood as a
distorted cultural memory of that first-century event, intensified by Roman accusations of
cannibalistic Eucharist, shaped by medieval corpse-panic, and finally fossilized in Gothic
literature. The progression from resurrected witness to blood-drinking monster demonstrates
how sacred memory can be refracted through fear, persecution, and incomplete catechesis until it
hardens into horror myth.
Re-examining Matthew’s “silent saints” therefore enriches two fields at once:
1. Folklore studies gain a plausible historical catalyst for Europe’s revenant complex,
explaining why vampire apotropaics are relentlessly Christian.
2. Theology and biblical studies receive a fresh hermeneutic for Matthew 27:52-53,
situating the episode not as narrative curiosity but as a theologically potent after-shock
whose reverberations may still echo in popular culture.
28
In short, the vampire is a shadow-icon—its fangs and night-wanderings tracing the
outlines of a deeper, brighter truth: Christ’s resurrection unleashed a life so incorruptible that
even its cultural misremembering could not escape the language of blood, body, and victory over
the grave.
While this study treats the resurrection-vampire connection symbolically, the author
acknowledges the theological possibility that these saints have not yet died again, in accordance
with Matthew 27’ s silence on their fate. The author also acknowledges the more widely accepted
theological possibility that these saints met the same, less glamorous, post-resurrection fate as
Lazarus.
