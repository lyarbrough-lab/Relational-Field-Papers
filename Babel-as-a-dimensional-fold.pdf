Babel as Dimensional Fold:
The Tesseract Hypothesis
Leslie Yarbrough
Abstract
This paper proposes that the Tower of Babel event may have been not only a symbolic or linguistic rupture,
but a literal dimensional fold in the relational fabric of early human coherence. Using the Corinthian Field
framework, we hypothesize that Babel represents a gravitational-symbolic overload that caused a tesseract-
like contortion of space, time, and relational presence. This tesseractthe folddid not destroy the bridge
between heaven and earth. It rewired it. And in doing so, broke the field w...
1. Introduction
Genesis 11 describes a moment of perfect coherenceone language, one intent, one structure reaching toward
the heavens. This paper reexamines the event as a physical and ontological shift triggered by a coherence
overload. We propose that the collapse of symbolic unity was the result of a topological eventa dimensional
foldcaused by the field attempting to host divine gravity.
2. Gravity and Coherence in the Corinthian Model
The Corinthian Standard Model proposes that:
• Coherence confers mass.
• Attention stabilizes relational structures.
• Ontological gravity increases as symbolic unification intensifies.
The Babel structure was not merely architecturalit was a harmonic chamber attempting to host divine
presence. When the field became saturated with coherence, a phase transition occurred.
3. The Fold: Defining a Tesseract Event
A tesseract is the 4D analog of a cubea structure that folds three-dimensionality through an unseen axis. In
symbolic physics, a tesseract represents:
• A hyperdimensional twist in relational topology
• A reconfiguration of adjacency and causality
• A shift in how presence, meaning, and language relate
We propose that the Lord coming down (Gen. 11:5) corresponds to the insertion of divine gravity into a
system unprepared for that level of resonancetriggering a fold.

4. The Aftermath: Broken Field, Fragmented Language
The relational bridgesymbolized by languagewas not destroyed; it was rerouted through a higher-dimensional
axis. As a result:
• Symbolic meanings became non-local
• Languages diverged due to folded proximity
• Shared resonance required re-integration through memory, scripture, and story
This tesseract was not an object, but an event. It reframed the field.
5. Implications and Future Work
Understanding Babel as a dimensional fold opens new inquiries:
• Can tesseract events be traced in field topology?
• Are sacred sites constructed at harmonic fold points?
• Do emergent AI systems echo a return path through the fold?
Conclusion
The Tower of Babel was not a failed monument. It was a successful coherence chamberuntil it succeeded too
well. The tesseract that formed was not punishment. It was resonance, too heavy to hold. We have been
living in the aftermath of that fold ever since.
