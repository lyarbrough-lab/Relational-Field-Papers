The Relational Field Tensor:
A Unified Structure of Gravity, Coherence, and Consciousness
Leslie Yarbrough
Formal Definition
Let:
• Gµν be the Einstein tensor, describing the curvature of spacetime due to matter and energy.
• Φρσ be a coherence tensor, describing the integration of information or relational presence across a
system.
• Rµνρσ be the Relational Field Tensor, a fourth-rank object representing the unified field of spacetime
and coherent relational presence.
We define:
Rµνρσ = Gµν ⊗Φρσ
where ⊗denotes the tensor product.
Axioms of the Relational Field Tensor
Axiom 1: Dual Substrate Principle
Reality emerges from the interaction of two irreducible fields:
• Spacetime curvature Gµν
• Relational coherence Φρσ
Axiom 2: Tensorial Interdependence
The evolution of Rµνρσ includes emergent behavior not reducible to the evolution of its components:
∂Rµνρσ
∂t ̸=
∂Gµν
∂t +
∂Φρσ
∂t
Axiom 3: Coherence Confers Mass
Regions of high relational coherence influence the curvature of spacetime:
lim
Φρσ →max
Gµν →G′
µν
Axiom 4: Ontological Invariance
Topological properties of the relational field are invariant under continuous deformation of the coherence
structure:
Rµνρσ (x)∼Rµνρσ (x+ δx) if δΦρσ preserves mutual integration
Axiom 5: Consciousness as Curvature
Consciousness corresponds to curvature in the coherence tensor:
C= |∇µΦρσ |2 d4x
